Chime took slightly more time to investigate, but still reports they found nothing wrong. They refuse to take a statement from me and listen to what I had to say. I even provided proof after the cases were closed and they refuse to open the case again, even after saying they would. I looked online and Chime has a long, long record of this issue.

They denied my dispute and supported their denial with payments I made on the account in XXXX. Their evidence is prior to the date my dispute begins and is therefore irrelevant to my dispute. Let me explain : I recently learned that my soon-to-be ex-spouse has committed significant identity theft and credit card fraud against me. He found some old credit cards of mine that I thought were closed and used them without my knowledge or consent. ( He also opened several credit cards using my personal information, without my consent or knowledge. ) My soon-to-be-ex spouse then built up a lot of debt in my name, mostly to fuel his addictive habits that he had led me to believe were under control. To my knowledge, I did not benefit from any of these unauthorized charges. He accomplished this because he was abusive and controlling and had full control of the mail, and because he took advantage of my vision impairment to ensure that I did not have access to any evidence of these debts that arrived by mail. I am working with a lawyer and have filed police reports and reports with the FTC. \\n\\nWith the help of staff at my attorney \\'s office, I found that beginning sometime during or after XXXX he charged thousands of dollars to an old Discover card of mine, account ending XXXX. He then tried to pay it down without my knowledge by opening an account with a debt repair company called XXXX, also in my name and without my knowledge or consent. Most disturbing is that he appears to have also forged my signature on a court settlement agreement with Discover as well. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we submitted a complaint packet for this unauthorized use of this account. The packet included : -- a cover letter from my attorney explaining the situation -- a letter from me detailing the fraud ; how I learned about it, how I understand it occurred ; how my spouse admitted to it ; and requesting that they cancel the account and find me not responsible for the debt because the charges were unauthorized. \\n\\nDiscover did not reply for a long time. On XX/XX/XXXX they requested additional information, including information that we had already sent. On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent them an additional packet of information, including Discovers additional information form, where I made clear that I was disputing all charges after XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX Discover responded that they did not accept our dispute. They claimed that their investigation found the account balance to be accurate. For supporting documentation, they sent images of checks that I had written in XXXX. \\n\\nTheir supporting documentation demonstrates that they did not conduct a thorough investigation based on the facts that we shared. I opened this account some years ago, but I had stopped using it. I explained on their fraud form that I was disputing all charges during and after the year XXXX. The fact that I made payments on the account in XXXX is irrelevant to the complaint that I submitted. It was not until sometime around or after XXXX that my spouse began putting unauthorized charges on the account. Therefore, payments I made in XXXX are NOT evidence that charges made on the account after XXXX are authorized. \\n\\nIf Discover had done a thorough investigation, they would have found enough evidence to determine that I had stopped using this card and this debt is not mine and is a product of unauthorized use, such as : A significant gap in use of this card between when I stopped using it and when my spouse found it and began using it without my permission. \\nAll wet ink signatures on any documents after XXXX do not match wet ink signatures from when I opened the account or on checks I wrote to make payments prior to XXXX. \\n\\nDiscover did not conduct a reasonable investigation into these unauthorized charges.

When XXXX failed to place a temporary hold on my account inXXXX of XXXX ( even though I called to orchestrate a temporary hold ) which would have reduced my bill to {$60.00} per month, I was charged full price for the next four months and had to deal with billing upon returning home iXXXX of XXXX. I complained and explained that I called to place a hold on my account due to being out of the country for the past few months. Nothing was done to remedy the situation. I paid my huge balance and assumed theywould simply restart my service. I was then prompted by a customer service rep to restart service under a new account, which would require a technician to come out and install new equipment and also require that I pay {$200.00}. Not only did the tech come out and restart my same equipment, but this caused confusion with XXXX yet again and they charged me for having my old equipment and new equipment ( i.e. new equipment that I never received ). I later found out that XXXX immediately charged me {$470.00} and said it was for me not returning my old equipment. I had to go back and forth with that particular rep, insisting that I never received newcable equipment, was still using my old equipment, and asked her what they did to keep track of their boxes that were sent out. I got no straight answer, but I refused to do the problem solving on this issue since I am not an XXXX  employee. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the day after the new service installation, my internet cut out. I had to call once more to tell them that their \" newly installed service \\'\\' was not working at all. I was then credited {$200.00} to my account for the inconvenience and a technician was scheduled to come out to fix the issue. However, I never received a stable internet connection from the day of my \" new \\'\\' service, so I ended my XXXX after the 3rd week of not being satisfied. From my understanding, XXXXdoes n\\'t hold you to any contract, especially if you cancel before 30 days of your brand-new service. At some point, I logged into my account and noticed that the {$200.00} credit had disappeared. When I flagged this to another rep and also inquired about receiving a refund for the {$200.00} payment, I was told that the refund would be credited to my card. I had to call and follow up on this refund and was told by another rep that I would receive the refund via check, mailed to my new address. This never happened and so I tried to dispute this charge with my bank. I am assuming that XXXX gave them an excuse as to why I should not receive a refund. \\n\\nNow here comes the equipment issue.

The agent I spoke to in the Credit Card department they told me it could take up to 30 days, and repeatedly stated I had requested it would be returned by ACH to the source bank, which I had not. I had not provide routing or account information for a return transfer, because it is returning to a credit card, not a checking or savings account. I was advised to give it a \" few days \\'\\' for resolution. \\n\\nThe agent told me the way the payment is represented on their end does not align with the actual events of the payment. This is also concerning, because there is either a system issue or agent issue. Neither bodes well for the accuracy of their service and security. \\n\\nBank of America lied to me about how my funds would be reimbursed.

USAA only states \" due to your account activity or usage with us or an affiliate \\'\\'. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2022 I was in the process of making a {$50.00} donation, but it didn\\'t go through. My credit card ( ending XXXX ) kept getting declined. I then went onto my USAA app to check for the issue and found that it was closed out. I contacted USAA credit card department first to inquire why my account was closed. I was told that USAA had made a decision to terminate it\\'s relationship with me ( all products and services ). The agent I spoke to had notice a letter that was generated that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to notify me that USAA was planning to terminate it\\'s services with me. Mind you, I was never given a heads up on the matter and found out about this issue because of my credit card being declined. The agent attempted to review everything, but could not find the answer as to why USAA decided to cut ties with me. They involved their supervisors and was also told that the supervisors couldn\\'t figure out the main reason to the termination. I did an online search as to what would be the cause of USAA terminating me, but could not find any answers. A similar response what always came up was \" banks have within their contract a clause stating that they reserve the rights to terminate anyone without a reason \\'\\'. I understand that this would apply if I found an egregious transaction within my accounts, but I couldn\\'t find anything that would raise a red flag. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : The following day I contacted USAA again and was connected to their agent, XXXX, who also told me that they were not able to find the reason why the accounts are being closed and just provided the info on what I needed to expect moving forward. I was then transferred to XXXX ( account reviewer ) who couldn\\'t figure out the issue then I was transferred again to a Security Specialist by the name of XXXX. They attempted to figure out why my accounts were being closed, but was not successful. However, they went above and beyond and assisted me in submitting a reconciliation request for USAA \\'s services. I was later then contacted by another security specialist, XXXX who stated they were going to review my whole account and contact me back in XXXX hrs. I did not hear from anyone. \\n\\nThe following days I contacted USAA to figure out what I needed to do as they closed everything out and I was not able to utilize my debit or credit card. I had nearly $ XXXX in my checking account and I was told they wouldn\\'t release the funds to me until everything was closed out within XXXX days. \\n\\n( I\\'m not sure how banks are allowed to do this because all my money was in USAA. I had all my auto payments and deposits going into USAA. What if someone less fortunate that I am and not skilled enough to figure out what happened and couldn\\'t pay bills and whatnot? I believe that when banks close out their client \\'s accounts via this method, it is very detrimental for someone who doesn\\'t have the means to cover their financial matters ) The last few weeks has been a mess trying to open up a new banking account and making sure auto payments were changed as everything was under USAA. All I have received were letters from USAA. USAA never called me to let me know about this issue and I still have not received any contacts from them, unless I made the call myself. I don\\'t mind USAA terminating my XXXX years of using their services if I can be provided with a detailed explanation as to why they made the decision to terminate me.

The first thing I asked was if they could close my account immediately to stop any fraudulent activity on it if that hadn't already happened. The first response I got directed me to reset my password which I promptly did. After I realized he wouldn't be helping me any further I decided to close the account myself. When I tried to though it said I needed to contact support again, which I reluctantly did. I was asked to show pictures of what the problem was, so I asked to use my coworkers phone and sent pictures of what it said to the support agent. He then responded in a lengthy copy and paste message about breaking tos. After that I was completely ghosted and no one eould respond to me. When I called I was met with the same copy and paste paragraph. All I wanted was to close my account because it had been compromised and I didn't want any personal information left in the account. After doing some research I found that many people had gone through this same exact issue with PayPal unfairly limiting their accounts with no stated reasoning other than breaking tos which led me here. They have still refused contact with me even though I am owed some kind of knowledge of what happened. This is completely fraudulent and this is not the first time things like this has happened. Apparently many others had their accounts revoked to and their money taken out their own account for paypal to keep.

We make our mortgage payment every month within the allotted time period to XXXX. Sometime over the course of our mortgage, the loan was apparently sold without our knowledge. We were never notified of any change in lenders. Over the years, we have continuously made all our payments to XXXX and were never instructed to do otherwise. In XX/XX/XXXX, we were served with \" intention to foreclose \\'\\' by an aggressive predatory mortgage lender who we had never heard of, called PHH Mortgage. During this period, PHH Mortgage refused our payments by returning our payments back to us thereby, prohibiting us from making any mortgage payments placing our loan in serious default. We requested our payments be held in escrow by our attorney. Our total sum was presented to the XXXX County court judge, where after the case was promptly dismissed for insufficient proof by PHH to show default by us, [ the homeowners ], and insufficient proof of serving us through proper legal procedure as mandated by federal law. As of XX/XX/XXXX, PHH Mortgage is attempting yet another foreclosure proceeding against us. Since our previous experience, we have kept accurate records and confirmation of all our payments. Please NOTE : All our payments continued to be paid to XXXX, the name PHH Mortgage was never used or authenticated at any time, even after the court case. Not at any time were we ever instructed to change our payment procedure. Each year, we were provided only with a coupon-style payment book with CB/MSC imprinted on the cover with a XXXX XXXX phone number inside the book to make phone payments to Mortgage Service Center. We also never received any statements at any time. Currently, we believe that over the duration of our loan, there may have been critical errors made during the time of transfer. Furthermore, PHH has harshly imposed, what we believe to be, ludicrous, erroneous, and hostile accumulative fees stating that we owe in excess of {$10000.00} in late fees ( basically the entire term of the loan ), resulting in charges being placed against our loan, severely damaging our credit, placing us in default, and a letter of \" Intention to Foreclose \\'\\' in order to justify the demand to collect on these unsubstantiated and unwarranted charges. CB/MSC/PHH has done everything in their power to ignore and delay an issue by ignoring prior written requests for our payment history, making it difficult for us to resolve an issue without legal representation, thereby incurring additional excessive costs, placing the homeowner in a vulnerable and almost impossible situation to overcome, and causing emotional and financial duress. Once again, PHH has begun returning our payments and blocking any payments made by phone. We believe their claims to be incorrect, grossly exaggerated, and unjustified thereby causing egregious accumulative and excessive charges, and we also believe CB/MSC/PHH will go to great lengths to validate, impose, and collect on these bogus charges. Furthermore, we have also questioned payments made to our homeowner \\'s insurance company, as they have refused to acknowledge, or purposely delayed a reply to any of our correspondence requesting information relating to our homeowner \\'s insurance, or our payment history. It is our belief that they have disingenuously replaced our insurance with their own, thereby forcing us to bear additional unwarranted charges. According to XXXX XXXX, CB/MSC/PHH terminated the insurance on their own. As of XX/XX/XXXX, PHH Mortgage has begun to formally identify themselves. To the best of our knowledge, our own records show that we have never missed a payment during the entire term of the loan.

The following is a chronology of the events surrounding the fraud, remedial efforts taken by me, and the basis for my complaint against XXXX : Local Chase Branch On XX/XX/2022, I logged into my Chase account and noticed a {$1400.00} transfer I did not recognize. The transfer had taken place on XX/XX/2022. The same day, I went to the Chase bank branch and spoke to the teller to dispute this charge. The banker pulled my account and indicated that it appeared that someone had hacked my home computer and used my bank ID to make the fraudulent transfer via my cell phone and the XXXX application. \\nDespite confirming that no one else had access to my cell phone that day, the teller instructed me to go home and run an antivirus scan on my computer, change passwords to my email and social media, change the phone number tied to my bank account, and change my Chase user ID and to try and use an XXXX Computer. I was also instructed to change my cellphone number and email, which I did and in turn reported it to the bank to update my information. \\nThe teller further provided me with the phone number and name of the receiver of the transfer : ( XXXX ) XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I confirmed with the teller that I did not recognize this phone number nor its owner. XXXX XXXX, it appears that the owner of the phone number lives in XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nThe teller further advised that I report this hack and fraudulent transfer to social security and request credit reports to see if anything else had been compromised. \\nI was provided with the contact information to dispute the fraudulent transaction directly with the Chase theft department, along with instructions to use my original ID account number as an identifier. The provided phone number for the department is : ( XXXX ) XXXX. \\n\\nChase theft dept. communications I spoke to Chase on the phone using the contact number provided by the bank teller on XX/XX/2022. In addition, they gave me a claim id # XXXX and I was again, provided with the same instructions the bank teller had given me, i.e., changing passwords, running an antivirus scan, etc. \\nThe Chase Theft department representative asked if I knew if anyone else had access to my phone, or if I knew XXXX XXXX ( the suspected hacker ), to which I again confirmed that I did not. I was questioned several minutes to which I replied I had no knowledge of the transaction. I was told that the fraudulent transfer could have only been effected via my personal cellphone as the fraudulent transfer was done and confirmed with face recognition. \\nI explained that I had never used face recognition on any transactions through Chase, let alone my cell phone. I asked if Chase could provide me with the image used for face recognition to confirm I had not personally make the transfer and was informed that this information is not stored by Chase. The theft department representative instructed that I contact my cell phone service provider and request a report confirming that I had never used face recognition on my phone. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX In-line with the Chase theft department 's instructions, I contacted my cell phone provider, XXXX XXXX XXXX through the company customer service number and was informed that the requested report could not be provided as it doesnt exist, and that the bank representative should have known as much. \\nWith the above information, I again called the Chase theft department. I was ultimately informed that they would investigate the issue. On XX/XX/XXXX, without further notice, I noticed that my account had been credited the amount of {$1400.00}. I believed my claim had been resolved. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I left the country on a previously planned vacation and did not return until XX/XX/XXXX. During my time out of the country, I had limited to nonexistent internet or cell phone access. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the day after my return to the U.S., I accessed my Chase bank account and found it blocked with instructions to contact Chase to resolve the issue. I contacted Chase to unlock my account and was informed Chase would not unblock my account until I paid an outstanding balance. I initially believed the representative was referencing another fraudulent transfer. The Chase representative explained that the XX/XX/XXXX credit to my account in the amount of {$1400.00} had been reversed. After inquiring as to why, I was ultimately informed that Chase had attempted to call me during the time I was out of the country and for the sole reason of being unable to contact me, Chase had made the decision to reverse their original position and deny my claim. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I went back to Chase bank to appeal the decision in person. I spoke with XXXX XXXX who went through the same basic questioning I had originally received on XX/XX/XXXX and she asked why my bank account wasn't closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I didn't know and I was told the claim took two weeks to process. None of the other bankers and representatives I had spoken up to this point had ever suggested closing my account. XXXX XXXX again informed me that my account should have been closed on XX/XX/XXXX and a new one should have been opened. \\nXXXX XXXX called the Claims department to reopen the same claim. She then instructed that we should do a police report and submit the report to Chase in order to reopen the claim and continue the dispute. She gave me Chase Customer Claims phone ( XXXX ) XXXX and Claim Number # XXXX. XXXX XXXX restored online access to my account and labeled it as compromised. \\nFollowing this new advice, I went to the XXXX XXXX Sheriffs Department and given information to file a report online at identiytheft.gov. I was told the police department no longer takes such fraud police report. \\nXXXX XXXX asked me to bring the police report so she could fax it to the Claims Department so they could reopen the claim. I explained to XXXX XXXX I had to follow the instructions of identitytheft.gov in order to produce the report. \\nI was instructed by identitytheft.gov to request my three credit bureau reports to check for any fraudulent activity. Then I was to fill out an online application with identitytheft.gov and reportfraud.ftc.gov and consumerfinance.gov. \\nI received a letter from Chase dated XX/XX/2022. Stating, the account is overdrawn by {$1300.00} and to make a deposit to bring to a XXXX balance. I called the phone in the letter and spoke with XXXX and XXXX # XXXX. I asked if the claim was re-opened and was told the claim was never reopened. \\nConclusion I diligently reported the fraudulent transfer to Chase the day after the transfer occurred. I timely followed every instruction given to me and relied on what I understood to be the resolution of the claim to my detriment. Ive gone above and beyond to resolve this issue with Chase and have followed every instruction, only to be stonewalled at the end. \\nDue to the foregoing, I submit this complaint against Chase bank and request that my claim be re-opened and that the balance of {$1400.00} be re-credited to my Chase account. I have enclosed supporting documentation with this letter.

Now this has caused great distress as MCCarthy acting as Attorney \\'s and acting as a claimed Sub of Trustee would then have no underlying client being this situation. \\nUpon Review of a Federal BK filed, XXXXXXXX XXXX handled hand carrying false claims to the Federal Court - stating that another was the owner, NOT XXXX. Then at the end of the BK McCarthy took over this file and claimed worked on behalf of INVESTOR XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX as INVESTOR - Obviously this claim is not true. Admitted as not true by XXXX on this DATE : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by OMBUDSMAN named XXXX XXXX. She confirmed verbally on an approved Recorded Phone Call. And sent a Letter that shows XXXX as Lender by email directly. NOW this is causing MCCarthy to not have been hired by their claimed \" Creditor \\'\\' as no link exists to their claimed client except by a Forged Backdated Assignment from a non lender making a cloud on the title. Now McCarthy has also hand carried fraudulent documents to the Federal Courts on my \" other \\'\\' Property ( which will is right now under Commercial Crimes Division AND given to the FBI ) as an underground Deed Theft Ring is making up FAKE Bank Names and stealing from the Servicer \\'s, and this Slander of Title caused to be mistaken as truth when a false claim and false figures and omitted loan payments were made and stolen from homeowner for 7 years of payments missing. Now a Review of the Documents recorded at the Federal Court AND filed at the County Records. \\n\\nFinding that a FAKE SUB OF TRUSTEE made up by XXXX and their Notary that is non compliant and no matching links whatsoever to this party making claims. That underneath all these false Sub of Trustee \\'s that have NO REAL CLIENT and do n\\'t seem to care that no real creditor exists on this XXXX \\' Note -- and is making false claims. \\n\\nMcCarthy is working AKA XXXX XXXX XXXX. When acting as XXXX this firm used Deceptive Practices including \" Mailing of a Notice of Sale \\'\\' to the Wrong Address. To purposely NOT Notice homeowner of a Sale Date. This pattern continues. This has been a ton of illegal claims by the Attorney \\'s claiming to act under laws, claiming to the Servicer \\'s that have also convoluted false claims of having hired attorney firm via a power of attorney that has no real link. That MCCarthy & Holthus is closely related to the schemes that are misrepresenting the Federal Courts and to the County Records FALSE CLAIMS knowing that representations are not possible. Then slide into a role claiming that they are not really Attorney \\'s acting even though they told the Judge in the Federal Court they were in fact \" Attorney \\'s \\'\\' and had a \" client \\'\\'. That also produced forged notes ; The note that they have is a fake note ; forged note by a pre-dated allonge that was now somehow created before homeowner ever signed her documents. This is NOT Possible to be a true allonge and in a CFPB Complaint to XXXX Bank - XXXX had and holds a different Note having NO allonge and is more similar to that of the homeowners\\'note therefore A FORGED NOTE IS HELD BY MCCARTHY & holthus that is not a true note and appears was Stolen or under laws would constitute a Stolen Note. \\n\\nNow McCarthy & Holthus claim that they now DO NOT REPRESENT XXXX - that they represent only XXXX. However XXXX states opposite that MCCarthy IS their Attorney and advises on the Applicable State laws of procedures on foreclosures. Which under the laws of CA State are non compliant to State Laws. This includes having been noticed of mistakes on their face, and failing to abide under CFPB laws and under CA applicable laws. A Letter was sent to them and they failed to respond. \\n\\nAnother Letter was sent, Email was sent, and a Breach of Contract was sent as well as Notice of Error \\'s on figures, and Breach on the underlying item 16 noted in the Deed of Trust NOT upheld. Again, No Answer has come. \\n\\nUpon looking at the Recorded Documents - and the claims made ; Bogus Forged Note ; a Lender that says \" they are not the lender \\'\\' and now XXXX claiming that YES that Lender that said they were NOT the lender is NOW the Lender - - XXXX continues to state They are NOT The lender however they had stated they were until the Regulators fined them in several lawsuits and finally they backed off - NOW XXXX acting solely as client for MCCArthy is aiding and abetting false fake \" Investor \\'s \\'\\' named as XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX states today that XXXX is the INVESTOR. MCCarthy states \" only \\'\\' client is XXXX however on paper of the NTS and acting on the defective NOD is another story that McCarthy was hired as the Sub of Trustee specifically assigned to their XXXX entity to claim that they have a \" different client \\'\\' a 3rd party Trustee of a Trust. THIS IS NOT TRUE. However MCCarthy & XXXX XXXX do not care if they have a real client. \\n\\nThey are also now linked to a fAKE BANK and an Auction Company - XXXX XXXX and XXXX who are behind the backs of any real Bank making up FAKE BANKS AND stealing from their own clients. This has included a Property targeted for DEED THEFT and now MCCarthy being the link and XXXX another firm as the LINK to the FAKE DEED THEFTS. \\n\\nThis along with breaking every single applicable law failing to answer, when they claim they would answer and continuing to cause Slander to Title of my property. This note was a XXXX \\' XXXX Home Loan who went defunct in XXXX \\' at that time was informed they would rewrite terms ; instead a claim later by XXXXXXXX XXXX said they took over XXXX XXXX XXXX -- later finding that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX \\' this note was not an Asset and WAS NOT taken over by anyone known. However XXXX allowed and claimed to be owner and Servicer. Then once caught by the Regulators changed \" who \\'\\' they are. This caused \" no underlying real entity \\'\\' to be known. However this did not stop XXXX from passing the paper trail to allow XXXX to make false claims and hire this firm now to AID in the false claims by a faulty FORGED NOTE and omitting 7 years of payments. Further abuse has continued. This has been horrendously abusive for the Attorney \\'s to ACT as if they have a Creditor Client when NO Such link is possible OR exists. This is part of a scheme that apparently is only now getting so out of hand that underlying SEC Regulators and the USDOJ are slowly getting this mixed up claim. Please find this a request for XXXX to make sure that the legal process is \" legal \\'\\' for them to foreclose against all procedural laws and to know that IF foreclosed upon by wrong parties that they will be named as they are disregarding all applicable laws, and have been found to have brought fraudulent forged notes to the Federal Courts. I am attaching the two versions of the NOTE -- One from XXXX and the other from XXXX -- obviously XXXX has duped their attorney firms OR these firms are willing participants as now they are in clean up mode of stealing from the clients that they claim to represent. A fake Forged Note, a Fake Sub of Trustee self created to make false claims, and no review under mandatory laws to review per CA laws ; CC 2924.17 & 18 and under all CA pre=foreclosure mandatory procedures to be upheld by any such Sub of Trustee and have skirted the entire applicable laws State and Federal Laws. The forged note is NOT the borrower \\'s signature and was duplicated to then back date both a mix up for title records do not match the Note ; The allonge was pre dated to the loan and the allonge shows a XXXX as the XXXX \\'s name. This is bogus. The original note is no longer enforcable as it was time barred and however under operation of law - no laws are upheld by any Attorney \\'s as they are making tons of money to aid the \" Servicer \\'s \\'\\' who are in this case pretending a real investor exists however that Investor XXXX states they are NOT the Investor.

      "['2019-05-24', 'Credit card or prepaid card', 'Store credit card', 'Problem with a purchase shown on your statement', \"Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement\", \"I have attempted to establish an automatic payment allocation request in order to pay on my revolving account and then excess to be applied towards my promotional balance. Despite numerous efforts and various individuals on-line and via phone I never could get a clear response on whether I could establish this request, which by the way this language ( automatic payment allocation request ) was provided to me by the credit card company ( Department Stores National Bank ) associate via email on XX/XX/2019 @ XXXX. Despite my efforts I realized that the only way to ensure I could make payments on my promotional balance was to make a one-time payment after my monthly auto payment posted. So on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX I called and spoke with a gentleman who during the conversation stated he COULD set up the automatic payment allocation request ( according to website the conversations are taped ). So I made my one-time payment ( {$530.00} ) towards my promotional balance and my {$300.00} auto payment had already been processed since it is an auto payment, but the statement was not available until XX/XX/XXXX for me to know what Macy 's had done. Previous months my auto payments were in the amount of {$400.00} and always had been applied towards the revolving credit and outstanding balances, per Macy 's policy that monies are applied to revolving and outstanding balances. Anyway I requested, because this associate said he could it for me to set up an auto payment of {$800.00} for the following month ( XX/XX/2019 ) and out of that {$800.00} I would have {$300.00} applied to the revolving and outstanding balances ( which exceeds the minimum amount due ) and {$500.00} towards my promotional balance. I requested some type of confirmation from him after I made this arrangement and I was told he could not provide such a document at that time. I then received notification on XX/XX/XXXX I had a message from Macy 's and noticed the letter stated auto payment of {$300.00}. I then realized there was an error. I called and spoke with someone who then told me no such auto payment allocation request program exists, despite me being told via phone and email that it did. I then clarified that the {$300.00} was only to be applied to revolving credit and outstanding balance and I would then pay the additional amount each month to pay on my promotional balance. I then received my statement on XX/XX/XXXX and realized that they had applied my {$300.00} auto payment partially to my promotional balance instead of being applied to the revolving credit and outstanding balance. The odd thing about all this is that I knew that I had to wait till my auto payment posted, which I could see on the website it had by the XXXX of XXXX. I waited purposely for that posting so that when I made that one-time payment of {$530.00} that all of that would be applied to my promotional balance. Plus all of my previous auto payments have been applied to the revolving credit and outstanding balances ( which according to Macy 's is the process and expectation ). Due to the historical mis-communication issues I have had with Macy 's and the ongoing lack of consistency in receiving information from Macy 's I decided I would also email my request after I made that call on that letter I received about setting up auto payment of {$300.00}. I did so to ensure this issue would be documented and had the expectation the error would be corrected. But the email response I received brought me concern as it stated it would take 1-2 billing cycles to correct the problem. Which does not make any sense when they can debit my account within 24 hours but takes them 30-60 days to correct the problem. Due to the error on how the auto payment was  applied ( not completely to revolving and outstanding balances ) my interest accrued was higher. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement my minimum balance due for my XXXX payment was {$150.00}. I had an auto payment of {$300.00} and they applied only the minimum due ( {$150.00} ) and took the remaining of the {$300.00}, which was  {$140.00} and applied to my promotional balance. I had already made a one time payment of {$530.00} for that balance that is why I wanted the {$300.00} towards my interest accruing balances, which is what they have done since I set up auto pay. In my May statement they applied {$7.00} to higher interest ( 27.49 % ) to the balance of {$120.00} charging interest accrued of {$2.00} leaving a balance of {$110.00}. The remaining of the minimum due which was {$150.00} was applied to the lower interest ( 26.75 % ) to the balance of {$2900.00} charging interest accrued of {$67.00} leaving balance owed of {$2800.00}. So if they had applied the payment correctly an additional {$140.00} would have been applied and I would have had a lower balance and less interest accrued. Actually if you review how they apply my payments that {$140.00} would have paid off that balance of {$120.00} because typically they apply $ XXXX {$150.00} to the other account each month. When I inquired to Macy 's on the issue and concern about correcting the interest accrued once they apply the monies correctly they would not respond to that question specifically. I have sent 4 emails demanding that answer. In lieu of their unethical and unreliable communication and business practices I fear they will not account for their mistake and I will not get the benefit I should have gotten without their mistake. Plus I asked them as well in those repeated emails to confirm that mistake would never occur because the evidence of what I said is in the tapes and reinforced with numerous emails. I also requested to be sent the credit card agreement on how they apply payments, basically their business practices in reference to how those practices directly affect me. They informed no such document exists. Now I find that highly unlikely when many individuals would like to read the fine print, but no fine print to review. How can that be legally allowable.\", 'Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', 'CITIBANK, N.A.', 'FL', '32765', 'Servicemember', 'Consent provided', 'Web', '2019-05-24', 'Closed with explanation', 'Yes', 'N/A', '3253329']\n",

I paid the {$14.00} balance which had increased to {$16.00} after fees had been accessed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

During this conversation, I was informed that I would not receive a late payment report on my credit report because they do not report a late payment until the account is 60 days past due.

On XX/XX/XXXX we received an offer for asking price which was well over what we owed on our home, we owed approximately at the time {$430000.00} and we got an offer for {$460000.00} on the home a few weeks later we got the appraisal back on the home and the home came in around {$430000.00}, we panicked when we realized we would not be able to cover closing costs to sell the home at this point we were already one month behind on our loan I hopes we would close on time so we had already been in contact with the lender which is Shellpoint New Rez to arrange a payment plan to help avoid Missed payments on the loan. After realizing we could not close on time due to the home appraisal, coming in too low, we went back-and-forth with the lender for what seem to be weeks trying to figure out how to close on the house to avoid any more missed payments and we were told that doing an assumption would be our best route, after being told that a short sale could not be done this early in missed payments because it is not really conventional to do a short sale unless you are at least four months behind on your loan, so we chose to try to go for a assumption, we went through a process of trying to get an assumption approved for over a month and it seemed like no one ever knew how to help us when I called the lender and I continued to get transferred to new people in different departments, and no one could ever figure out what to do about my assumption so after realizing that we kept missing our deadline to close on the house and having to extend the deadline on closing at least three times at this point. I called the VA and asked them what to do because I was running out of time as we kept messing payments on the loan. The VA told me assumptions arent very common and it probably wont get approved unless we bring the loan payment current since we were behind on the loan payment three months. I called the lender once again and spoke to someone new once again because I could never talk to one person this lady told me that yes, the loan needed to be current in order for the assumption department to even consider doing an assumption on the loan but for the last four or five weeks, no one told me this, and I had just assumed that the assumption was getting approved since the loan was at a loss mitigation level since it was three months behind it wasnt even being considered for an assumption, but no one could tell me that because no one knew, and at the time I had a point of contact that never reached out to me or contacted me so I didnt have one resource to reach out to just a bunch of random people that would answer my phone call And tell me a bunch of XXXX so after realizing the assumption was not going through, and the VA told me a short sale would probably be the better route to take. I got the buyer to agree with a short sale after him already waiting three months to figure out if he was going to be able to buy our home, thankfully he agreed to the short sale so we presented the lender with a short sale package and sent them all the documentation that they needed, well weeks have gone by and we still are having issues contacting the point of contact on the loan which is named XXXX XXXX in the loss mitigation department. I have spent hours trying to get through to this company trying to figure out how to sell our home without reaching a foreclosure status I have called and called. I have emailed and emailed I have complained on the website trying to figure out how to avoid foreclosure, me and my wife are decent people. We have served our country for the last 15 years in the XXXX. All we were trying to do was move to a different state to take a job so that we could feed our children and afford to live. I am lost. I dont know what to do. The Lender does not care about us and it just seems like all they care about is the money we cant afford to pay our mortgage anymore because we had to move to a different state and pay for new housing. Weve had a buyer that has been interested and desperate to buy our home since XX/XX/XXXX and he has been loyal to us but the problem is unless the house appraises we are kind of screwed, and our last option is the short sale. We have already seen two reported missed payments hit my credit report. If I foreclose on this home, I will lose my security clearance and I will lose my job. I am trying desperately to work with this Lender, but it doesnt seem like they want to work with me. I have been desperately reaching out to them since XXXX trying to figure out the best avenue to repay my loan the short sale isnt far off from what I owe as the lender would receive roughly {$400000.00} of the loan after commissions are paid. Please help me please do what you can to help me figure out how to deal with us. This is the worst lender I have ever dealt with.

When received and placed in my kitchen the refrigerator had several scratches, dents and a screw drilled through the appliance. I refused the delivery, but the drivers spoke little to no English and still left the appliance ( I did not sign anything ). I immediately called the store and spoke to a woman who asked me to text her pictures of the damage. Once I sent her pictures, I had to follow up several times over a two-week window. My last follow up I was advised that a check was mailed to me for a 15 % discount. I stressed again as I had been that I don't want the fridge. The {$250.00} dollar discount does nothing for me, I do not want the fridge and at this point the {$250.00} barely covers the warranty I paid for that is now void because there is a screw drilled through the appliance directly into the product. \\n\\nThe first dispute with the credit card company XXXX I was told was not in my favor because I was offered a discount, which I never got or agreed to. My statement reflects no discount, and I never received a check. This discount does nothing for me, I want a functioning new fridge that I paid for and expected to get. After that dispute I was told to file another dispute, so I did. After I submitted the second dispute and paid a minimum due of {$77.00}, I started to get statements reflecting a negative balance, total credit limit of $ XXXX available credit {$10000.00}. The statement also reflected a previous balance of {$2100.00} and a credit/refund of {$2200.00}, balance- {$77.00}.

The first representative said in the beginning that my extra amounts were in fact applied, which was a flat out lie. I know because somehow my balance kept growing?! After telling her that this was not true she then looked again and said that my extra amounts were going towards interest? Now mind you I 'm paying and have been for YEARS the interest only portion and yet my balance continues climbing.

The Making home affordable Handbook for servicers Version 5.2, Chapter V Second lien Modification ( 2MP ), Process states in relevant part : When a borrower fist lien is modified under the Home Affordable Program or a qualifying GSE Standard Modification and is reported in a match file issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, ( XXXX ) on or before XX/XX/XXXX ( In the case of HAMP ) or on before XX/XX/XXXX ( In the case of GSE Standard Modification ) as having been permanently modified, the 2MP servicer must offer to modify or extinguish the corresponding second lien ( 2MP ), according to the steps outlined in Section 5. Services may, but are not required to, offer to modify or extinguish the corresponding second lien when a borrowers lien is reported in a match file issued by XXXX XXXX after XX/XX/XXXX as having been permanently modified under the HAMP. In addition, if the borrowers first lien is modified under HAMP or a qualifying GSE Standard Modification, the 2MP servicer must dismiss any outstanding foreclosure action on the borrowers second lien, provided that this requirement will cease to apply after XX/XX/XXXX, except where the corresponding first lien has been reported as permanently modified in a match file issued by XXXX XXXX  on or before such date. ( See HAMP Rules, handbook 5.2. \\n5. On XX/XX/XXXX, we executed a credit agreement under the Home Affordable program. See permanent loan modification agreement attached hereto. On XX/XX/XXXX, we provided sufficient notice to BB & T home Equity that we had permanently modified the first lien under the Home Affordable Program and therefore pursuant to the HAMP Handbook and directives we requested BB & T to either modify the second lien or extinguish the debt. See fax confirmation hereto. BB & T signed an agreement with Tarp and entered into the Loss Mitigation Program. BB & T ignored the request and failed to adhere by all Treasury Directives. Attached see BB & T loss mitigation application to avoid foreclosure downloaded from their website at the time, yet they deceived us by stating that they do not offer loss mitigation retention or participate in any treasury program, contrary to what their website reflected. See attached BB & T loss mitigation checklist. \\nAccording to the HAMP Handbook 5.2- When a borrower modifies the fist lien under the HAMP prior to XX/XX/XXXX, the second lien holder must dismiss any foreclosure action. \\nBB & T filed a lawsuit instead of offering loan modification. To file a foreclosure action when the first lien have been permanently modified prior to the statutory date of XX/XX/XXXX, is unlawful and most definitely a violation of treasury Rules. Florida is a Judicial state and must adhere by statutes and Federal Rules. The reason as to why treasury created such programs was to preserve home ownership and to stabilize communities. 12 U.S.C 5201, U.S.C 5213. BB & T ignored all these Federal Rules and moved forward with the foreclosure action. Under Florida Law, the bank must refute defendants affirmative defenses in order to win summary judgment. See Florida case law, case no. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX v XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\\n\\nBB & T, filed a motion to strike our defenses to the HAMP rules and directives. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Judge entered an order striking all of our defenses except for the Home Affordable argument. BB & T could not refute this defense. However, even though Florida Law is very specific that summary judgment can not be entered unless plaintiff refutes and wins, at a later time the judge ignored the law and entered a final judgment. We appealed to the Florida 3 DCA court of appeals. Despite Florida Case Law regarding failing to refute defendants defense and the Treasury Handbook and Directives, the 3 DCA issued an Affirmed decision without elaborating as to why. We were stunned by their decision and investigated further. Attached please see an article made public by a law firm whom conducted an investigation and provided the foreclosure statistics to the 3 DCA. if you carefully review the statistics you will find that something terrible is wrong with the 3 DCA while adjudicating foreclosure cases. Alhtough other districts have ruled on for property owners and issue written opinions, the 3 DCA have denied the same argument and not issue an opinion. The 3 DCA actions are unconstitutional, if everyone has the right to a fair trial, how can their ruling be constitutional when the 3 DCA is ignoring Florida law and federal rules. The 3 DCA has gotten very far, and its time for a Federal Investigation. Are these Judges promised an intensive? we do not know, but the statistics speak for themselves. We should not trust any opinion in connection with foreclosure cases from the Floridas 3 DCA Court of Appeals. At this juncture, the court of appeals even demanded that we pay BB & T attorneys fees, which is bizarre. The treasury implemented the Handbook as a guidance for servicer 's and the judicial courts to follow. In this case, the treasury Rules were ignored by Judge and the fraudulent Florida 3 DCA.\\n\\nBB & T, 3 DCA, CFPB, need to know the following : Under Florida Section 687.0304 ( 2 ), a debtor may maintain an action on a credit agreement unless the agreement is in writing. We entered into a credit agreement in writing under the Home affordable program. Under Florida section 687.03049 ( 1 ) ( a ). a loan modification ... .is both an agreement which extends credit and which makes a financial accommodation, thus implicating the banking statutes of Frauds. See XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Fla. XXXX d DCA XX/XX/XXXX ). This opinion was issued by the 3 DCA on  XX/XX/XXXX. Yet they affirmed the summary Judgment going against their own opinion??????? definitely something wrong here. The credit agreement we entered came with many financial accommodation that would precluded a foreclosure action. One another accommodation, was to either modify or extinguish the second lien. The 3 DCA forgot that they even issued that opinion yet they affirmed BB & T conclusory arguments. Indeed the actions of BB & T are of Unfair Deceiving Practices must worse then this, the 3 DCA has gone against their own previous opinion on the subject matter and this is should be investigate by the Office to The Attorney General of Florida. We are going to file complaint against the 3 DCA and provide case law and demand a Federal investigation since we are dealing with officers of the court and Judicial or government.\", 'Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', 'BB&T CORPORATION', 'FL', '331XX', '', 'Consent provided', 'Web', '2018-08-16', 'Closed with explanation', 'Yes', 'N/A', '2993586']\n",

In XXXX, Navient informed me that all forebearances and deferments had been depleted, and at that point, they encouraged me to apply for an Income-Based Repayment plan.

My first complaint is transunion will not remove a loan that is reporting with XXXX that I do not owe. It is showing a balance of {$860.00} it is showing open/collection/charge off. I received a letter last week telling me that they will not re-investigate this anymore for me. This is a violation of my rights that they are reporting inaccurate information which is affecting my credit. My next complaint is I have been disputing XXXX in the amount of {$4800.00} which again I do not owe. This was paid in full when I turned in my lease. It is reporting my new lease payment which is correct but then showing a monthly payment of {$4800.00}. Common sense shows that a auto payment can not be {$4800.00} per month. I have disputed this with transunion and they keep responding it has been verified. I also contacted XXXX and was told that I have a XXXX balance as my old loan was paid off in full with no late payments. Another complaint I have is my XXXX account which is also paid off to a XXXX balance is still reporting a balance of {$120.00}. I contacted XXXX and was told they have contacted the credit reporting agency and verified that I have a XXXX balance on my account. Transunion responds the balance of XXXX is correct. This shows me that they are not doing a valid investigation. My credit score is low due to wrong information that transunion is refusing to correct. I am about to obtain legal advise as I have been dealing with this for months now trying to correct my report. Transunion also agreed to remove some of the XXXX remarks they are reporting which again is affecting my credit score. To date they still did not remove any remarks.

Accordingly, I contacted Chase on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, immediately after I noticed this fraudulent charge on my account. \\n\\nChase \\'s response was to initially investigate the charge, and because I am in the process of buying a house, I went ahead and paid the charge just so it did not show a balance and potentially affect my credit rating while I was being underwritten for a home mortgage. \\n\\nChase then credited the charge back to me, and I thought that Chase had properly determined that the charge was fraudulent. However, when I called to have the money that I had paid be transferred to another credit card at Chase, Chase indicated that the charge was still under review and that the extra money I paid was stuck in my credit card account. \\n\\nThen on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, Chase called me in the afternoon while I was at work, and told me that they had to debit the charge back to my account, because their research showed that I had used my Chase credit card with XXXX when I flew the airline last summer.

I reiterated no to both questions, as I had indicated many times to many people with whom I spoke at Chase. He then tried to call XXXX to ask them about the charge, and after keeping me on hold 15 or 20 minutes, he got back on the phone with me and said that XXXX unfortunately couldn\\'t be reached. He never volunteered to have Chase call XXXX during normal business hours. He basically just tried to kick the liability back to me. \\n\\nFinally, on Friday afternoon, another Chase agent said she was submitting my \" case \\'\\' to the \" rebill \\'\\' department because Chase would have to further \" investigate \\'\\' and potentially \" rebill \\'\\' the transaction.

For instance, that fraudster could have been a restaurant where I used the card. Or it could have been some online source.

BofA Business banking advised us that we could get a good deal on XXXX Payroll services if we each established personal checking accounts with BofA & used Direct Deposit. Each of us applied online for personal checking accounts and were approved. I went to BofA in XXXX and got a temporary personal ATM card on XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX/XXXX/16 As a business, we contacted XXXX to find out how to set up payroll through BofA. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I bought breakfast with my temporary BofA personal ATM card at XXXX XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I went to buy breakfast from XXXX and was told by XXXX that the BofA Personal ATM card was inactive. XXXX : I called BofA from XXXX, XXXX and was told my personal ATM card had been reported \" lost or stolen \\'\\' and I \\'d have to get another card. I called back less than an hour later and was told my account was frozen and closed and that I had to personally go into a branch to retrieve my account balance and could not receive any further information over the phone. I was working XXXX & could not stop working to drive to BofA 2 hrs away. This caused me to be without food and our business was forced to incur a XXXX fee from XXXX because this was the only way the co-owner could send me payroll funds to allow me to have food to eat. On XXXX/XXXX/16, Saturday morning I traveled 2 hours to get to Bank of America to retrieve my funds and attempt to find out why I could not access my account and why it was frozen. Upon reaching the bank, XXXX bank representatives in XXXX tried to assist me. We contacted a phone number for internal Bank of America reps that said my account was frozen and closed due to suspected identity theft. I stated that I was in fact XXXX XXXX and I had opened the account and they said that it was too late now. I \\'d have to re-open an account with new funds. In addition, they would not give me my bank balance in person. Instead, they mailed it 4 hours away to my home in XXXX, XXXX. Here \\'s the problem : 1st : After opening the personal acct, I went in person into BofA branch w/multiple forms of identification ; sat at desk of a branch rep & got a temporary ATM card. I \\'m on VIDEO! A brief investigation would \\'ve uncovered this information. There was no identity theft to warrant closing/freezing my acct 3 days AFTER I WENT IN PERSON ; 2nd : They told me to drive to a BofA branch to get my money, but when I paid expense to get there to retrieve much needed gas/food money they refused to give it & said they mailed it to mt home 4 hrs away. 3rd : They caused my business to incur added cost. 4th : They discriminated against me personally, but not my business account. I want to know how and why they are able to do this. Last week our business filed a complaint against XXXX XXXX because over zealous investigators failed to release {$1600.00} dollar XXXX payment to us from our business customer. XXXX got no customer complaint, held the payment for a week & then made contact w/our customer & misled him by announcing they were Fraud Division. He thought it was an unrelated charge. I personally drove 2 hours back to the customer to find out what was said. The customer wrote me a check for the {$1600.00} and I used that check as an opening deposit with Bank of America Business Account with the intention of making Bank of America my new bank because I did not appreciate XXXX & XXXX handling of the matter. It \\'s my belief that my complaint against XXXX may have something to do with this treatment by BofA because BofA approved my personal account but then committed bad business practice by closing my account w/out even calling me to notify me of their action.

Immediately upon discovering this I notified my bank J.P Morgan Chase of this issue and filed a fraud claim. Additionally I filed a police report with the city police for the crime. Now this crime was unique in the fact that my card was taken from my wallet without my knowledge then returned as a means to hide the actions of the perpetrator. I explained this to Chase and they issued me a credit for the amount lost, and sent me a new card. My case with the police department was worked by a detective that handles financial crimes, surveillance tapes were reviewed, and an arrest warrant was issued for the individual that had stolen my card. \\n\\nAfter this had occurred on XX/XX/2017 I received an email from Chase stating that my fraud claim had been denied and that the credit would be removed from my account. I reached back out to the chase fraud department and asked for an explanation, they stated because my bank card has a chip and because it was in my possession at the time of the transaction no theft could have occurred and therefore my claim was invalid. I explained again what had happened when the crime occurred, the representative said that a new claim would be opened and the claim reversal amount was never removed from my account. \\n\\nAfter receiving no information from chase on the status of this investigation, on XX/XX/2017 I noticed a transaction on my account for a claim reversal for the previous amount stated of {$210.00}. I contacted Chase bank and they said part of the issue was there being two claims open for the same transaction. The rep closed one of the claims, and said that the credit would be returned to my account within 3-5 business days. \\n\\nToday XX/XX/2017 I contacted chase bank to follow up and inquire why the credit had not been returned. The first rep I spoke to had stated because the claims department was attempting to contact walgreens to verify information about the transaction and that there was no timeline as to when this would be completed. Being dissatisfied with this I accepted an offer to speak to a representative in the escalations department. This rep I spoke to then informed me that there was no open claim and that chase had completed their investigation, and that the credit was properly removed from my account and would not be returned.

I filed a Bankruptcy last year XX/XX/XXXX and worked out a deal with my lenders. Everyone except the XXXX student loan worked out a deal. However, they did n't appear in court because they had sold the loan to Navient. Long story short, I am unable to pay the monthly payment on the XXXX loan that is now owned by Navient. My lawyer XXXX XXXX has been trying to roll the XXXX loan into the Navient Settlement, and to finally work out a payment arrangement. I can not pay the loan currently because all my money is going towards the Navient settlement and other student loan settlements set forth in the adversarial hearing through the Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy that was discharged XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is servicing the loan. I called them to explain that my lawyer XXXX XXXX is working with Navient to roll the XXXX loan into the new agreement for repayment. Navient has stated that they will not be able to do anything until all the loans roll over completely sometime beginning early next year of XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX through the CFPB and they stated they could not do anything to forberance or defer the loan payments because they do not own the loan. Navient is dragging their feet rolling the XXXX loan they bought into the settlement that was done through the court. 1. I can not pay the amount that is owed to the loan and continue to pay the other loans that I agreed to in court with Navient. 2. The only way this can be solved is if Navient puts a forbearance or deferment on the loan until they roll it into the agreement through the chapter XXXX bankruptcy that they have agreed to do. I have called XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for a deferement or forbearance and they will not allow it they believe I am still in bankruptcy and that is not true. Also I can not afford a modified payment on the existing loan for XXXX because all my money is going to Navient directly for the other loans on the new agreed terms through the bankruptcy. I have been trying to get this worked out for over the last 3 months, before XXXX affects my fathers credit and mine. I need Navient to put a deferement on the XXXX loan until they can figure out how they will wrap up that loan into the chapter XXXX agreement terms and settle that without using the servicer XXXX. XXXX has refused to help extend, modify adjust or allow me to defer my payments even though they know that Navient is working with my lawyer. I need Navient to put a deferment on payment until they can roll this loan into the agreement we made with the court during our adversarial hearing. I can not make any payments on this loan. This is why I had to file ch. XXXX and show my income, what I could and could not afford, and renegotiate the loan agreements. I have no money to make all these payments, and if this continues I will fail on my newly renegotiated agreement with Navient attached below. No one is communicating and it is hurting me because I can not afford to pay these loans.

Called Seterus to review my mortgage payments made in 2015, they claim I only made 6 payments but in fact, I made 9 payments. One rep advised me that the payments made during the Trial modification period does not count towards the escrow account which is ludicrous. I requested a breakdown of each mortgage payment I made and received a XXXX page document which was difficult to decipher. I need a simple, XXXX or XXXX page breakdown of each payment I made and how much was applied to interest. Seterus says I paid only {$6400.00} ( approximately in interest in 2015 ) but I made XXXX payments each payment was about XXXX dollars, some more some less. I have attached a copy of the payments debited from my account at XXXX XXXX XXXX although XXXX payment is not visible. I made monthly payments beginning in XXXX of 2015 when the trial modification began through the end of year, XXXX 2015. I filed a complaint against Seterus last XX/XX/XXXX regarding the change in payment amount from {$1700.00} to {$1900.00} or so, the complaint number is XXXX. In their response to you, they lied and said the reason the loan documents were completed in XXXX was because they sent them to me in XX/XX/XXXX and I did not return them until XX/XX/XXXX. That is a blatant lie. I was advised the documents would be sent a few weeks after the loan modification was over which was back at the end of XXXX 2015. I had to call every week asking were the documents were and finally got the documents in XX/XX/XXXX. I signed, notarized them promptly and returned them asap. This organization is so unscrupulous and no one is paying attention. Anyway, here are my payments and the confirmation numbers I have, although I do not have all confirmation numbers, the attached document clearly shows my bank account at XXXX debited for the mortgage payments 9 times which would mean I paid more than XXXX ( approximately ) dollars in interest in 2015. The amount of XXXX implies I only made six payments which is what Seterus says I made. I believe the discrepancy lies in that Seterus did n't apply interest to my account during the three month trial modification period and if that is the case, where did that money go? In XX/XX/XXXX, they raised my mortgage which triggered my complaint to you and they lowered the payment but their reason for doing that was the escrow account was short, perhaps it would not have been short had they applied the interest from the trial period to the escrow account. I had to apply for an extension to file my taxes because the document I asked for, which was a simple breakdown of each payment came in the form of a XXXX page document. In summary, in order to file my taxes I need accurate interest paid data from Seterus and need them to show I made 10 payments beginning in XXXX of 2015 and ending in XXXX of 2015. Here are the confirmation numbers, dollar amount of payment and date for several of them, not all. \\nXX/XX/XXXX, confirmation # XXXX, {$1700.00}, XX/XX/XXXX, confirmation # XXXX {$1700.00}, XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$1700.00}, XX/XX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$1900.00}, XXXX confirmation # XXXX {$1700.00} and XX/XX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$1900.00}.

After all, I started off making a fortune. Chase 's wi-fi got into my XXXX and possibly altered its configuration. In my XXXX XXXX XXXX  app it said that Chase would hold daily 10s of thousands of dollars payoffs to be held for 9 days and then paid to my account ending in XXXX. These payments never happened. Chase of XXXX XXXX, Texas informed me that my account was blocked due to insufficient funds and sent my gold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Jersey.

Upon not understanding what the legal tender was, he called Chase back office for assistance.

During this time period, I received calls from Chase employees at least 2 times a week requesting payment and stating that this is an attempt to collect a debt. I stated to them each time that I presented them with a payment and that a copy of it should be in their system while they are researching it. They confirmed that it shows in their system and I should hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received some information ( but not all ) from the XXXX and nothing regarding the Security I presented.

After 11/2 to 2 hours of back and forth telephone conversations, they wanted to postpone the call until today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). XXXX requested that it be expedited because I was there and available that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ).

This was escalated by the Fl Attorney General \\'s Office in XXXX and I STILL have no resolution. There is a bit of background to my case so I will explain by being as brief as possible but without leaving out any details. \\nI purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXX. WF approved my loan with a falsely understated amount for my escrow payment. Within XXXX days of closing my payment increased by several hundred dollars due to the escrow payment alone. They increased it again the second year although my property taxes and insurance DID NOT increase. Still, it was affordable to me. \\nTime passed and I started a business. Everything went very well for a time. Then, I had a rough quarter and fell slightly behind on my mortgage payments. I asked WF several times to review me for a repayment plan but they refused. I continued making monthly payments but was in a bit of a delinquent status due to my temp. inability to catch up all the payments at once. \\nThen, last summer I went away for a bit. During this time I made several payments via XXXX XXXX as there were no WF branches in the state I was in and WF would\\'nt accept payments online. \\nWhile I was out of town WF came to my house with foreclosure paperwork and shoved it into the hands of a friend of my family who was visiting here from XXXX on XXXX. She is not a XXXX and does not understand or read XXXX therefor, according to Fla. statues their \" service \\'\\' is invalid. Furthermore, they served this paperwork without previously sending me a notice of default nor a notice of intent to accelerate the loan. I have asked them on numerous occasions to provide proof of these things and they have sent me XXXX photo copy of a collection letter. They have n\\'t sent any of the additional information as they do not have it. \\nCome to find out, they did not apply XXXX of the payments that I made through XXXX XXXX. So while I thought I had XXXX payments to make up WF was claiming that I owed XXXX. I had saved the receipts to I sent them to them and they did research for about XXXX days. When they finally located the payments they returned them to me!! These payments were made when my loan was still in good standing and they should have been applied to my account. I \\'ve demanded that they explain themselves and why they returned the payments and they claim I requested them to be returned to me. This is a bold faced lie. All I have wanted to do is get my loan straightened out. I would never ask for money to be returned to me. \\nAnyway, I owed XXXX months plus the XXXX missing payments ... This totals XXXX. However after WF located and returned the payments to me they were claiming I owed XXXX months. I am not sure who at a bank is so incompetent that they think XXXX but it clearly does not. I have asked them to explain and correct this as well and they can not and refuse to. \\nThen, after I filed a complaint with my Attorney General \\'s office they began to review me for loss mitigation options. They should have BY LAW done this before attempting to file a foreclosure. Now, they have had the file for over XXXX months and they are playing games with underwriting. They are claiming now that I owe almost one year in payments but this is a direct result of their stall tactics, losing XXXX payments and refusal to review me for a repayment plan last year when I clearly qualified for one.

I then took it to a XXXX XXXX, it was repaired and covered. Many more things began to go wrong with the car. I took it to a different auto repair service center who said it had an electrical problem that is quite expensive also only the dealership would fix it. Eventually, the AC went out, the repairs for that was {$3200.00}. There were other problems the check engine light was on, the mileage indicator was flashing and other warning lights were on as well as the engine needs service message. I called American Acceptance the Loan company to see if the would assist me in any way. They advised me maybe they can if I would get an estimate of the repairs. I went to an auto repair a place that repaired my car in fact it was the same place that initially told me that only the dealership could fix it. They gave me an estimate unfortunately they did not put everything in writing, he said because he can not get prices for many of the parts. He also told me that all the work that is needed on the car it would not be worth it, and the difficulty in finding the parts they do not want the job. The finance company said they would take off 85 % of the value of the vehicle but I would have to get an estimate showing the repairs are more the value of the car. the value of the car is {$4100.00} to {$5000.00} in good running condition this car is not. The repair as it is now is more than {$3200.00}, to get an estimate from the original place that gave me an estimate they need {$400.00} just to diagnose the can system which is to do with computers. So I went back to the dealership and they said over the phone it would be {$150.00} to diagnose but when I got there it was {$170.00} for 3 things he wasn't done telling me the different diagnosis the car needed because all of the codes that came up, I stopped him because I could not afford more than the {$170.00} he said it would be about {$1000.00} to diagnose my vehicle. I basically told the finance company that I can not do both pay for the vehicle repairs and car payments, I asked to please assist. the problem is I can not afford to get it diagnosed they also need it to be not drivable which it is, and the motor or transmission needs to be replaced. This is very unreasonable since the repairs so far is {$3200.00} The Estimate is {$1000.00} and the value of the car is {$4100.00} ... so far I have paid {$10000.00} the balance it {$17000.00} how does that make sense.

I carry a lot of blame and resentment for going to college for 4 years, and feel guilty that my mom ended up losing her house to put me through school. \\n\\nI began working with the lender to see what my options were, and soon discovered that I was unable to come up with any type of agreement with MEFA, or at the time, XXXX, while the payments continued to fall behind. A number of times I tried contacting them to come up with a repayment plan, and they just told me that because they were private loans there was nothing I could do until I was able to get the past due balance caught up. I called a number of different lenders and student loan companies to see about consolidation, but there was nothing. It appeared that was no real recourse for combining or lowering these private student loans. I spent the summer after graduation trying to resolve this enormous debt with little to no help or answers. I searched for a new full-time job, something that could help me pay this debt and other expenses that I had acquired. This was just around the time the market crashed. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I found myself at XXXX different jobs. One job that forced me to have a credit card for travel, which I did not qualify for on my own, given my loans and credit score, and one that I had been laid off from, after only being an employee for 6 months. I was laid off from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, when I finally was hired by XXXX. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX my mother received a summons from XXXX in order for her to settle on a repayment agreement for the private loans from MEFA. After acquiring a lawyer through a generous donation from my XXXX, we were able to reach an agreement of {$500.00} a month. In the heat of the moment and feeling like this was our only solution, my mother signed the documents and we came up with a repayment plan. Externally, I agreed to give her a portion of the money toward these monthly payments, as I was the one who had received the education. However, there were no clear terms and no real end date established, along with an absurd and unrealistic interest rate. As far as I know, we also have not received any monthly statements or any tax form documents since that time. \\n\\nPresently we are on a repayment plan trying to pay back {$66000.00} of the loans that was agreed upon, but it is supposed to be over a period of 7 years and the payments go up quite a bit each year, even though I am not guaranteed a raise of that much. Last year my raise was {$400.00} annually.

Those are funds that I paid as part of the refinance that were never credited to my escrow account as an opening balance. Second, rather than depositing the {$3300.00} as an opening balance, Mountain West Financial opened my escrow account with a negative balance of - {$4100.00}. Combined, this amounts to a shortage of - {$7500.00}.\\n\\nThe only thing that I can think happened is that someone at the bank accidentally entered XXXX as my opening escrow balance, which is very close to the the monthly payment of the loan, instead of the {$3300.00} that was to be deposited as the opening balance. \\n\\nTo make up this error causing a shortfall in the escrow account, during the escrow analysis in XX/XX/XXXX, Mountain West Financial has required an additional monthly payment called the Shortage Spread of {$630.00} to make up the shortage. \\n\\nTherefore, the monthly mortgage payment has increased from {$4100.00} to {$4700.00} because of this error. \\n\\nI have tried repeatedly to contact Mountain West Financial, but nobody has been able to provide any explanation or assistance. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, after I understood the error made by Mountain West Financial, I called Mountain West Financial and spoke with XXXX. We discussed the problem, she expressed that it was unusual for an escrow account to be opened with a negative balance, and she told me she escalated the issue, and would call me back. I was never able to talk with XXXX again. Over the next few weeks, I called multiple times and spoke with other staff, including XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). XXXX understood the general issue, and he was surprised the company had not contacted me, and recommended that I speak with XXXX. When I called the next day to speak with XXXX, XXXX said XXXX could not speak with me, and then hung-up the call, or at least it was disconnected. Each time I call Mountain West Financial and speak with a representative, they ask me for a call-back number in case we get disconnected, and when the call disconnects, they never call me back. \\n\\nFollowing the steps outlined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), I sent a written letter to Mountain West Financial detailing the error through the US Postal Service, using Certified Mail Return Receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. I received the Return Receipt postmarked by the Post Office on XX/XX/XXXX, signed by XXXX XXXX ( from what I can tell from the handwriting ). This indicates that Mountain West Financial has received the notice of error. \\n\\nThe letter was addressed to the mailing address that is listed on the back side of my monthly mortgage statement from Mountain West Financial. \\n\\nIF YOU WANT TO SEND US A QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST, A NOTICE OF ERROR, OR AN INFORMATION REQUEST, YOU MUST SEND IT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX, CT XXXX Attn : Customer Care Escalation It has been eight business days since Mountain West Financial has received the Notice of Error, and I have received no communication from the company. \\n\\nWhen I called today, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX PST, and spoke with XXXX, she said there was no information on my file, and when I asked how to escalate the issue or to speak to a supervisor, the call was immediately disconnected. At the beginning of the call, XXXX did ask for a return phone number in case the call was disconnected, but the call was never returned. \\n\\nPlease help my family and I. We did not expect to have such a large increase in monthly payments, which is causing financial hardship. Mountain West Financial is ignoring the error and is not communicating. \\n\\nWe are sincerely hopeful that the correction will occur before the next mortgage payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX.', \"Company believes the complaint provided an opportunity to answer consumer's questions\", 'MOUNTAIN WEST FINANCIAL, INC.', 'CA', '90803', '', 'Consent provided', 'Web', '2021-09-18', 'Closed with explanation', 'Yes', 'N/A', '4733533']\n",

Following my recent complaint I filed on XX/XX/2017 case number XXXX, which a response is now several days past due, I chose not to close this account due to the negative impact it could have on my credit score. In the past 30 days, I have paid {$10000.00} to Wells Fargo to pay the previous balance in-full. Today, my wife called Wells Fargo to pay the current balance in-full and was told by a representative that there are notes on our account that I gave the representative on XX/XX/2017 the wrong account number and that is was my fault. She was then advised that our account was flagged that they could not accept payments by phone from us any longer. She demanded to speak with a manager, because of how ludicrous this seemed and was told the same thing. The manager told my wife that they have notes that prove I left off a number when paying by phone on XX/XX/2017 and that we would have to mail our payment to them. My wife expressed her absolute dissatisfaction and displeasure with this obvious discrimination towards us. She said she does not have time to mail the payment and if they looked at our history, we have never mailed in a payment and have always either paid by phone or online. My wife told the manager that we might just payoff the balance and close the account, based on the terrible experience we have had lately with Wells Fargo. My wife told the manager she was speaking with that we have a linked account on file we use for payments and advised it was an error on Wells Fargo, which caused the payment to return due to no account found, not NSF. She could never get a legitimate or justified reason we were no longer allowed to pay by phone. This is complete discrimination and retaliatory, because of the first CFPB complaint filed. This is also considered a fair banking violation, because we are being treated differently than other customers. Is it a normal practice to not allow customers the option to pay by phone if a previous payment returned \" no account found? \\'\\' Is it a normal practice to not allow a customer to pay by phone, following a CFPB complaint being filed about the lack of service received and a UDAAP violation?

I provided the letter, and called Navient again to confirm they received the letter, and was told I was now on in school deferment. A week later I called to verify, and was told once again, I was on deferment. I then received a letter stating I was denied my in school deferment, so I again, contacted Navient. I was told there was a mistake, and to disregard the letter, and that I was on in school deferment. I tried to retrieve the letter from my Navient account for proof, but it no longer exists. I asked the representative if he was positive, that all loans were in deferment and he said \" Do n\\'t worry, I assure you, they are all on in school deferment. \\'\\' A week later I checked my account to discover this Tuition answer loan was in repayment and the amount due was XXXX per month. I called Navient once again, and they told me that there was a mistake, and that some of the customer service representatives did n\\'t know what they were doing. I was also told on numerous occasions that Navient had a fraud department, where XXXX students could call to get assistance with fraudulent private loans, incurred while attending XXXX University. This was not true, as I called every number they gave me, just to get the run around, and eventually got a number that was the ombudsman for federal loans, which clearly did me no good. After all the time and frustration and inaccurate information, I did a financial statement with a Navient rep. and was told that there was nothing they could do for me. My income and necessary living expenses and any left over money I had at the end of the month was not anywhere near enough to make a payment of XXXX a month. I was also told to rearrange my household expenses so I could afford the payments on this loan. I told the rep. that I had already done that by declaring bankruptcy in XXXX. I can not refinance my home due to my bankruptcy, and my car payment is already as low as possible. I am on a level payment plan with my utilities, I get a discount on my cell phone, and have cut grocery expenses for my family, there is nothing else I can rearrange or cut. I have no luxury items or un necessary expenses. There is no possible way I can repay this loan, and the Navient rep. advised me to put the loan in my available forbearance, which is nine months and then default. Unfortunately, this is my only other option, and in my opinion is completely unfair that I have to ruin my rebuilt credit, face unemployment or even the inability to gain employment, due to being forced to default. I work as a contract employee for the Dept. of Justice, and will lose my security clearance as well as my job, for defaulting on a private student loan. It was difficult enough to even get hired at the Justice Department with the bankruptcy that I have on my record now. I am a former XXXX University student, who was forced to take out private loans to continue my education. This tuition answer loan has an interest rate of 10 % and by the time its paid off, which it never will in my lifetime, as I am XXXX yrs old now, will have cost me over XXXX, on an original amount of XXXX. This is truly predatory lending at its finest, and should be illegal. I can not pay this loan, and it should have been discharged in my bankruptcy.

However, life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges that take a toll on one 's financial situation, resulting in missed payments and increased debts. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have recently gone through a hard time that has impacted my credit score negatively. I fully recognize the gravity of this situation and am actively seeking ways to rectify it. I understand the significance of having a clean credit report and the effect it has on my overall financial health. Therefore, I am making every effort to clear my debts and make timely payments to improve my credit score. I am writing to you regarding the matter of the debt assigned to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, originally amounting to {$890.00}, also assigned XXXX XXXX, XXXX originally amounting {$590.00}. I am also writing reguarding XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assigned XX/XX/XXXX original amount owed {$840.00}, also date assigned XXXX, XXXX XXXX original amount owed {$260.00}. While I understand the need for medical providers to collect and maintain patient information for purposes of treatment and billing, I want to bring to your attention a growing concern that has become prevalent in recent times. This pertains to the unauthorized sale of personal data by companies without the knowledge or consent of the individuals concerned. As a consumer, and a patient of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have the right to expect that my personal information is protected at all times and not misused for profit-making purposes. In fact, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) of 1996 was enacted specifically to safeguard the privacy of personal health information. I am disappointed to learn that my data may have been sold without my consent, and if that is the case, I urge XXXX XXXX XXXX to review its policies and practices to ensure that they are fully compliant with HIPAA regulations. The unauthorized sale of personal data is not only unethical but also illegal, and I strongly believe that no company should profit from the exploitation of sensitive information that belongs to its customers. I am committed to resolving this issue in a fair and amicable manner and would appreciate your cooperation in ensuring that my rights, as well as those of other patients, are respected and upheld. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\", '', 'EQUIFAX, INC.', 'TN', '38016', '', 'Consent provided', 'Web', '2023-03-23', 'Closed with explanation', 'Yes', 'N/A', '6735309']\n",

Also I Did Not consent to any of these things on my credit report I control my report not the other around. All of these items that are on my consumer report from third parties old debts and also the rental property has caused me and my family extreme hardship we are forced to live in an area that is not conducive to our lifestyle I can't get certain credit cards so that I can accommodate my family 's lifestyle.

They refused the items and I contacted Bank of America's dispute department while I was at the vendor. I took several pictures of the register area and surrounding counters and walls showing that there was no posted return policy for a customer to know what the return policy is prior to purchasing- its like entering a contract with someone without understanding the terms until after signing. \\nThe reason for the return was that I found out that I could buy the products from another vendor for about $XXXX less. In addition, the quality of the items was better at the other vendor. I made this purchase and attempted to return the other vendors items and they refused it. While I was on the phone with a dispute representative at the vendor's store where I wanted to return the products,the bank representative asked the vendor if he would take the items back over the phone and he still refused. He later told a different BOA representative that I had left the premises with the items without making an attempt to return them.

Information in a consumer report can not be provided to anyone who does not have a purpose specified in the Act. Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information.

She then asked me to finish off the prompts once it got to a question about income. This was a red flag, so I asked her if it was a credit card that I was signing up for, just to clarify. She assured me that it was not a credit card, that the income question was just to determine what kind of coupons I would receive. That sounded pretty odd, but I shook it off and continued on. Then, the prompt asked for my social security, to which I was really confused. I once again asked her if it was a credit card and she PROMISED that it was n\\'t.

She did the same exact thing to my fiance, and once we were on our way out of the store, I searched on the internet to see if Target had just a rewards card. Turns out, they do n\\'t. I was really upset and frustrated that this woman wasted ten minutes of my time to make us apply for a credit card when she explicitly told us it was not a credit card. My fiance called the store once we got home and complained about it, to which he was greeted with a rude customer service rep saying that we just \" misunderstood what we were signing up for \\'\\'.

The loan was scheduled to be paid off in XXXX of 2016. The withdrawals of {$640.00} per month ended after XXXX, as expected. However, new withdrawals of {$35.00} per month started. At first, I assumed that there must have been a small carry-over of some type, but the withdrawals of {$35.00} per month continued. I called XXXX to ask why they were continuing with these withdrawals, and they said that they did not, that my account was paid off. I asked for a telephone contact with Sychrony Bank, which they gave me. I called several time and was never able to get through to anyone. In XXXX of 2016 I went to XXXX XXXX and asked to have the withdrawals stopped, which they did. In addition, they pulled back the payments that had been made. \\nI received a letter from Sychrony Bank, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 acknowledging the cancellation of the automatic payments and indicated that I would now be responsible for making my own payments by mail, plus the late payment charges. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I sent a hand written response, indicating that I found the charges fraudulent and that XXXX reported that they had not authorized any collections. In addition, on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I sent a certified letter to Sychrony Bank, utilizing the process that their bills posted as the method of challenging amounts due ( copy enclosed with this complaint ) ; I also asked for an acknowledging that they had received a letter, in addition to the post card I would be receiving from the certified letter. \\nThey charged late payment fees of {$35.00} each time for these fraudulent charges, as well as interest and posted a late payment charge on my credit report. The late payment charges for 2016 were {$68.00} and interest in the amount of {$56.00} ( according to their bill ). According to their bill and the information from their customer support, I owed a remaining balance of {$120.00}, which I included with my letter, just to stop the process and demanded an immediate termination of my account with them. \\nI have never received a response to my letter nor a confirmation of the cancellation of my account with them.

When you contact them, they will probably tell you it was a one-off problem or some other total lie ( see second-to-last paragraph below. I am complaining because what went on today should not have ever happened. If they do n\\'t immediately fix the mess their computer made when I finally manage to get a human on the phone, I will be back to file a separate complaint about that. \\n\\nBackground : In XXXX 2015, I froze all my credit reports because my information was on the computer systems of XXXX companies that had been hacked, but only XXXX had offered me credit monitoring. Being a senior citizen, freezes were free, and {$10.00} for a temporary lift would be cheap peace of mind if ever I needed a credit check. Generally, I did not foresee opening new credit accounts. \\n\\nBut today, a Saturday, I wanted to change my home security-monitoring company, and that requires an Equifax credit score. I was on my phone with the new security company \\'s agent, which was OK because I did not want to use the Equifax automated telephone method. I knew I \\'d have to give my SSN to unfreeze my report, and I was n\\'t keying THAT into a cordless VOIP telephone! So I went online, just as I had done to establish the freeze, while the security-company agent waited very nicely on the phone. \\n\\nWhen I came to Step 2 of the Equifax process, there was text on the screen telling me to pick a date range for the temporary lift and provide my personal information, then press Submit. BUT, there were no boxes or blanks on that screen into which to enter the information! I clicked all over that screen for about 4 minutes, until suddenly a whole new screen appeared with the needed boxes. I filled out the boxes and pressed Submit. The Equifax system seemed to freeze again for about a minute or more ( you get that icon of a circling arrow that tells you the site \\'s computer is not going very fast ) and then it resolved. \\n\\nHOWEVER, the agent who was waiting on the phone was still denied access to my Equifax credit score. AND, when I looked at my email to see if the {$10.00} charge to my XXXX XXXX had been processed by Equifax , I had XXXX XXXX alert messages about online purchases made to my card -- all by Equifax , each for {$10.00}, and with time stamps of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX will work with me on this. \\n\\nI found a customer service phone number for Equifax that would reach a human 7 days a week from XXXX. to XXXX. ET ( XXXX ) -- it reached XXXX. After telling \" XXXX \\'\\' that her English was basically useless, she tried harder. She apologized but could not tell me if my credit report was successfully unfrozen and she could n\\'t help me with billing issues either -- for that I would need to call XXXX. I asked her what the hours of operation at that number are -- answer : M-F, XXXX.-XXXX. So I am in limbo for two days now. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE to wait until Monday!! \\n\\nAlso, this is not an isolated incidence of computer idiocy and malfunction at Equifax. I order my free Equifax credit report every XX/XX/XXXX ; it is always a battle with the Equifax computer to find the dialog that will let me download a PDF of my report ( unlike the XXXX and XXXX websites, where the downloads are easy to do ). Also, when I did the credit report freeze last year, the Equifax process was bumpy and full of frozen screens that took a lot of trust and perseverance to wait out ( but XXXX and XXXX processes went well ). Free credit reports, credit report freezes, and credit report unfreezes are all mandated consumer services.

I waited to activate it because I knew there was a monthly fee. I activated it this morning to gain access to {$30.00} my friend sent me via XXXX. I thought it was easier than having to wait until XXXX opens to get it. I \\'ve got guardianship of 3 children and needed the money quickly. According them, their terms and fees are listed in the paper work sent with the card. I looked over that paper work and only found where a few would be charged monthly. I went to use my card and out of the {$30.00} I got, I was only able spend {$20.00}, meaning they took {$9.00} from me in fees and I only used the card THREE times. They claim credit transactions are {$1.00} and debits are {$2.00}. While on the phone with them this afternoon I was told several different things about these \" fees \\'\\'. But not only that, I was breaking down the spending and how many times I used the card. IF there was a fee of {$2.00} per debit transaction, then {$4.00} in fees would be subtracted and I used it ONCE with credit ( total of 3 times using the card ) and that should only be {$1.00} fee totaling the fees to {$5.00}. XXXX, which is my main prepaid debit card that I pay no monthly fee or charge fees for took 2 amounts to validate the western union card. That was because I noticed they were taking too much out of my account when using the western union card. For some reason, I could get it validated so I could transfer the money over. The guy said a fee was charged for that and then ended up saying there was no fee for that because it was pending .... but if they charge {$2.00} debit fees, that would total the fees to {$9.00}. Here \\'s where they contradict themselves ... I had {$30.00} on the card. I used the debit to get {$10.00} in gas. After getting gas, my amount was down to {$18.00} and some change, meaning it was less than a {$2.00} fee they are claiming is taken out for debit transactions. I went to XXXX. My account had {$18.00} and some change. I spent {$3.00} after leaving XXXX my account was down to {$8.00} and some change, that \\'s about a {$9.00} or {$10.00} fee for using debit and they claim to only take {$2.00}. I went to the gas station and spent {$7.00}. After that my account was down to {$.00} or around that number. I used credit for that transaction and they claim to take {$1.00} for credit transactions yet less than {$1.00} was taken. 3 different people from this company told me 3 different things, lied about how much fees were, and again I never read anywhere about fees when using the card. In my experience with prepaid debit cards, I \\'ve only ever had to pay a monthly fee, or a fee to withdrawal money, but never for using it at gas stations and XXXX. I called them and went up the chain of command and asked them for the {$9.00} back that they not only took from but also from the XXXX yr old, XXXX yr old, and XXXX month old I \\'m having to care for. They absolutely refused to give it back. One person said they were the highest person to talk to and I told them no there are executives and I \\'d like to speak to one. Getting to talk to someone higher up was like pulling teeth. They still refused to give the money back so I demanded they closed my account and cancel my card. To me, this is a scam because they \\'re charging a monthly fee, charging fees for spending YOUR money without telling anyone, and then when you figure it out, they argue with you and have excuse as to why money ca n\\'t be refunded.

I did not choose this company - they purchased some existing student loans I had with XXXX, so I was never given the option to use the free market to find a company that provided better service. \\n\\nMy problems with Discover began almost immediately. The monthly payment amount they wanted was very high, and I was working for a non-profit, making too little to afford the payments. I called repeatedly to ask for a modified payment plan, but was told that they did not have one yet. So I made their payments and began to put necessities like groceries on credit cards. \\n\\nMy interest rates on my Discover loans are through the roof and keep going up : currently 7.75 % and 10 %. They 've gone up six times in the past year, including twice in a single month last XXXX. Because they keep increasing my interest rates, my payments go up, too, because the loan term does n't change. I asked if I could renegotiate the loan term to make my payments more affordable, and was refused. \\n\\nLast year, I experienced further financial hardship when I moved cross-country and changed jobs. While my increased hardship was temporary, as I had taken a higher-paying job with a for-profit company, Discover refused to grant me a deferment of a single month. My income was too high. I was instead granted a six-month reduction in my payment amount, from {$490.00} to {$380.00}. I still was unable to pay that month, but I diligently made every payment following, adding {$16.00} to each payment in order to make up for the missed payment over time. In spite of this, I began receiving calls three times day, every day, hounding me for the overdue amount. I requested that they stop or at least decrease these phone calls, and they refused, saying they were within the law. I had to block the number. I have not missed a payment since I had that difficulty last year. \\n\\nAt some point, my six-month payment reduction ended. I received no notice that it was ending, and did not even realize it had ended until I spoke with customer service today about my overdue balance increasing instead of decreasing. For months I have been making payments that I thought were a little extra, but were instead more than {$100.00} too little. \\n\\nEven when I had near-perfect credit, the only refinancing I could find was at a rate even higher than what I 'm paying now.

I was told that besides the usual creditworthiness etc, there were XXXX conditions. The loan should be a \" conforming \\'\\' loan ( amount less than {$410000.00} ), and there should be a 20 percent down payment. In a few days I called again to finalize the amount of the loan. I mentioned that based on the on the value of our house given by XXXX ( {$580000.00} ), 20 percent down ( {$460000.00} ) would exceed the the first condition, so I was considering {$410000.00}. I then asked if, on the other hand, I were to request {$400000.00} ( which would be 30 percent down ), would that lower the loan costs? I was told that it would not. The loan rate would not change as long as the criterion of 20 percent down was met. \\nSo, we filed an application for {$410000.00} and chose to \" Lock the rate for 60 days \\'\\'.

I complained, and I was told that the costs had gone up because the appraisal was too low. I pointed out that while one can raise questions about the method of appraisal, it still satisfied the 20 percent criterion, and as a matter of fact, their first reaction to the appraisal was that it was \" good enough \\'\\'. As a result of my protest the loan costs were slightly reduced, but they were still far higher than the original agreement. \\nIn a nutshell, in spite of promising a 60 day lock on the interest rate, effectively the rate was significantly increased.

It \\'s an oversight on the behalf of an employer in verified good standing with his bank, and understandable. The initial check was cancelled. A new replacement check was issued by the employer to my wife for {$800.00} dollars, the initial amount plus overdraft fees from the previous check. This replacement was subsequently deposited on XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo evidently expected this second check to bounce, as our bank account was frozen almost immediately after this replacement check was deposited. Wells Fargo opted to let me XXXX this in the checkout line at the grocery store by having my debit card declined on XXXX XXXX. My wife and I visited a Wells Fargo branch on XXXX XXXX, and learned from an associate that our account is not only scheduled to be closed, but also the balance of {$180.00} in the account would be withheld until we provide a statement from our employer \\'s bank verifying all elements of the transaction, and certifying that this check has been paid. The employer \\'s bank expressed puzzlement at Wells Fargo \\'s action in this case, but was happy to furnish the requested documentation directly to Wells Fargo, which was performed immediately. Wells Fargo did not attempt to contact me after this was done, or at all regarding any detail of these events. I allege that this lack of communication is unreasonable. Also, Wells Fargo \\'s apparent failure to independently verify the validity of this check after already having taken payment on it is dubious at best, as the timeline of events will show. Instead, having me perform this step. The validity and financial backing of the \" unexpectedly \\'\\' cleared replacement check for which our account is now being closed was never in question.

Today on XXXX XXXX, I visited a branch to learn that the replacement check had cleared, but Wells Fargo still had no choice but to terminate our account with no explanation. While our current checking account with Wells Fargo is less than six months old, our relationship with the company as our only checking account provider spans many years of good standing, and satisfactory account behavior. We had the misfortune to heed the advice of a Wells Fargo banker, who, when we asked how to prevent a cancelled gym membership to continue to bill our account automatically every month, suggested we simply close the account, and open a new account. Had I known that this action would reset our years of good standing with Wells Fargo, I believe I would have just paid the gym membership. I allege that Wells Fargo \\'s aggressive loss prevention initiative has unfairly targeted us as high risk, as characterized by their punitive action against us, being that there is no just cause. An associate mentioned that our account history, less than six months, is a factor in Wells Fargo \\'s decision. The company is choosing to ignore our history as upstanding customers, based on the fact that although they have been our only bank for many years, we closed and opened an account in the same visit earlier this year, on their advice, and that act reset our entire relationship. This checking account was the sole financial resource of a struggling family of XXXX adults, and XXXX small children who live at or below the 2016 Federal poverty threshold for annual income.

The mortgage broker did not adequately explain that his role was XXXX of finding a lender that would give me a new loan that had a lower interest rate. Unfortunately, shortly after he contacted me, XXXX. While I was recovering, the mortgage broker called me and told me that he had gotten me a lower interest rate and that I could start making monthly payments at the new lower amount. XXXX I assumed that the mortgage broker took care of whatever was necessary to get me a lower rate and trusted that things were handled properly.

We intended to use the account to purchase a property in XXXX. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful with our bids and therefore we did not use the account. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Suntrust via my online account and asked what was the best way to close my account and get the balance on the account sent to me. I was advised that the money could be either transferred electronically or paid by check. When I tried to transfer electronically the system did not allow me to do so and so I requested a check and was advised that this could take up to XXXX weeks to reach me. My online access was cancelled at this point and I waited for my check.

I contacted the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and asked for the status of my check as I had not received it. A gentleman called XXXX said he would look into this and email me with the details. He did not do this and so I phoned him again. He said he would send me an email. This did not arrive and so I phoned the XXXX again to be told that XXXX had gone home and would not be back at work for a couple of days. I then phoned the XXXX of SunTrust and I was told that the check had been sent out at the end of XX/XX/XXXX but had been returned as undeliverable in XX/XX/XXXX. I could not understand at the time why this had happened as I was told it was sent standard mail and would not therefore require a signature. The Bank had already successfully sent me the change of address card and so I was confident they had my address. On XX/XX/XXXX I was then told that because the check had been returned I would have complete an indemnity form which they would send to me. I was not happy with this as I would have to wait another XXXX weeks to receive this. At this point I raised a complaint about XXXX at the XXXX for not getting back to me as promised. My wife and I spent in excess of XXXX hours speaking to either the XXXX or the XXXX being passed from XXXX to the other because the account is a closed account. In a subsequent call to the Helpdesk I asked about the complaint I had raised and was told that there was no record of it on their system.

I suspect that the check was franked similarly in the XXXX and was rejected by the postal service somewhere because insufficient postage had been paid. I received a call from XXXX who works on the Research Team at SunTrust as a supervisor called XXXX had passed our case to the Research Team. I explained to XXXX that there was little I could complete on the indemnity form and that it is rather ridiculous that we have to pay to have our signatures only notorised when the Bank have a copy of our signatures on file. XXXX said she would check with another department and ring me back in about XXXX minutes. The following day XXXX phoned to say we need to sign the form and get it notorised.

Chase used this false claim as justification for Chase to refuse to accept a payoff payment from XXXX on XXXX XXXX in the amount and on the date that Chase itself had laid out in its payoff letter to XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, for my mortgage. \\n\\nRather than Chase accepting the payment on the XXXX, Chase held my money for a week, demanded additional interest and fees from me, which were paid on the XXXX by XXXX and me, in full, but under duress just to stop the clock. Instead, Chase should have accepted the payment on the XXXX and dropped its false claim that the payoff payment was insufficient due to Chase \\'s XXXX XXXX tax payment, a claim that seems fictitious, wrong, or perhaps intramural and should have been reversed by Chase. \\n\\n\\n**Issue II : Negligence in Informing Me and in Taking Timely Action to Address** As sketched above, XXXX wired payoff payment to Chase on XXXX XXXX. The first I learned of any issue with the disbursal was in response to my email to Chase on XXXX XXXX. Neither XXXX nor Chase notified me of the week long delay. The negligence I would argue goes against a duty of both parties to inform me -- which neither side did. \\n\\n\\n**Issue III : XXXX Illegally Closed with a Higher Interest Rate than the Agreed, Locked Rate** XXXX salesperson XXXX XXXX confirmed that I locked the interest rate at 3.819 %. This was then documented in XXXX Loan Estimate dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, showing the agreed rate and that it was locked. The Loan Estimate further reads that \" your interest rate ... can change unless you lock the interest rate. \\'\\' The rest of the Loan Estimate had major mistakes that I pointed out in an email the same day. \\n\\nXXXX issued a new Loan Estimate dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, correcting the portions stating that I needed \" {$330000.00} cash to close \\'\\' and that I was paying off \" {>= $1,000,000} \\'\\' rather than the the actual {$870000.00} that had in fact been discussed. \\n\\nI failed to notice at that time that the locked interest rate had been changed to a new rate of XXXX - and there was no notice to me and no discussion of a change. Unfortunately I did n\\'t notice that change until after we closed.

My main concern was that since no additional account information was asked to verify my identity, that basically if my card were to be lost in the mail, anyone who retrieved it would have been able to activate the card and use it. On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a response back from their customer support. The representative explained the process and I felt good about it. However in the response, the representative provided to me a phone number that \" was on my profile \\'\\'. To my shock, the number that was provided to me was NOT my phone number. Wells Fargo had provided to me another customers phone number. This has further raised my concern for my privacy/security. How do I know if that same representative provided MY information to another customer? This is a very concerning issue to me.

I planned to obtain a promissory note to purchase a used vehicle. A few weeks after they approved me for membership over the phone and sent me a promissory note and security agreement, I was unable to log into their website to view my account. After speaking to several representatives, I learned that I needed to \" verify my eligibility \\'\\' by submitting documents proving that I am in the military. When I asked them why I did not receive an email or phone call informing me of this issue, I received no explanation, but I was re-granted membership in the credit union. Then, after driving the car for an entire month, I learned from NFCU that because I purchased a salvage title vehicle ( it is a theft recovery with no history of collision ), a fact which I did not hide from them and which was freely available to them on the state \\'s XXXX XXXX search website, my loan would be converted to a \" signature loan, \\'\\' and the interest rate would go from 5 % to as high as 18 %! I asked why they missed the \" salvage \\'\\' brand in the title search, but they told me it was my responsibility to inform NFCU and that I was lucky enough to be paying the lower interest rate until the loan is converted to a signature loan. A representative pointed me to a sentence buried in the middle of a paragraph on the XXXX page of the security agreement that I signed to justify this interest rate hike. It reads : \" The owner ( s ) will maintain property insurance on the collateral covered by this Security Agreement against loss and damage with a collision deductible of no more than {$500.00}. \\'\\' He told me that this sentence justified NFCU retroactively hiking my interest rate because buying a car with a salvage title constituted breach of an agreement to maintain insurance on the collateral. I have insured this vehicle through XXXX, and their representative informed me that I had collision insurance up to the vehicle \\'s value. I did not realize that a salvage title would severely reduce the vehicle \\'s value, but I also did not nor do I think that this sentence in the security agreement or any of the statements made to me before I purchased my vehicle justify the interest rate hike that NFCU is trying to impose on me.

I spoke with a representative at XXXX XXXX and the representative was unable to provide a reason why I was unable to unfreeze my profile using Experian.com/freeze. I pointed out that I was able to login and view my credit report and score, and I used the information on the credit report when answering the identity verification questions at experian.com/freeze. The representative I spoke with sounded as if she read from a script as the information she stated was not relevant to the situation. \\n\\nI asked to speak with a supervisor and was told I would need to wait until the next day for a callback. I shared the urgency of lifting the security freeze as I was applying for a mortgage, she stated I could send a copy of my ID, a utility bill showing my current address and a letter asking to lift the freeze overnight to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX. They could also sent a PIN reminder via standard mail or overnight. However, the overnight option would be sent to an old address I lived at two years ago, not my current address. When I asked about the timeframe of how long it would take once they received my documents before the credit freeze would be lifted, I was told 15-20 minutes. I asked that if XXXX delivered the documents at XXXX XXXX, I should expect the freeze to be lifted by XXXX XXXX and the representative evaded answering the question, again, reading from what sounded like a script. Experian makes it very difficult to speak with a representative and I\\'ve spent many hours on the phone calling various Experian phone numbers I found on XXXX trying to speak with a live representative. \\n\\nToday is Tuesday, XX/XX/2019 and XXXX confirms the documents were delivered to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX address at XXXX XXXX and signed for by \" XXXX   XXXX. \\'\\' ( XXXX  tracking number XXXX ). The number I was given the day before to call and confirm receipt of the documents, ( XXXX ) XXXX-XXXX, was an automated recording and offered no option to confirm receipt. I called a number I found on XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX-XXXX. After waiting on hold for over 15 minutes, the representative I spoke with, whose name I could not understand due to the heavy accent, stated they had no record of receiving the documents but the department that handled that may not have entered it in their system. He stated it would take anywhere from five to seven business days to process the request. When I pointed out that the representative I spoke with the previous day told me 15- 20 minutes, he stated \" I don\\'t know why that representative would have told you that. \\'\\' I have not received a call from any supervisor as promised and I\\'m completely at the mercy of Experian \\'s terrible customer service.

The call went on for nearly four hours ( being transferred to three different representatives ) .The second rep XXXX was quite disrespectful and spoke over me most of the call so I asked to speak with her manager. I was transferred to XXXX, who was likewise not very professional. XXXX was rude and condescending to me on the phone and said that the Dispute was closed two months ago, despite getting my first request for  information by post XX/XX/XXXX. He told me this request was automated sand that they had decided my case in XX/XX/XXXX without any information or request for information. I said I was shocked and disappointed in Citi. He then told me I was just upset because I didnt get what I wanted. I said as a customer of 20 years I expect a legitimate investigation of the billing dispute and requests for information. He made a few more snide remarks so I said I would need to consider whether or not I wanted to continue being a Citi customer. He then asked are you confirming you want to cancel your card. I said no and then finished the call. When I woke up this morning, Citi had  cancelled my card without my authorization. \\n\\nI phoned in immediately and spoke with XXXX in customer service for almost an hour. I explained what had happened and he said that should never have happened and apologized profusely. He then said they would need to pull my credit report and reapply for a new card. I told him that I did not want my credit to be pulled as I have an XXXX credit score and did not want to get it tarnished because a Citi agent made a fraudulent cancellation of my card without authorization. \\n\\nXXXX again apologized and said he would refer it to the Office of the President. I heard back from XXXX XXXX from the office of the president a short while ago and he said he would look into it. He initially stated that because I stated I was considering terminating my account and then got off the phone that they had the right to cancel my card. I told him that that is not true, that I never gave authorization and also relayed that I had recently cancelled my XXXX XXXX  with Citi and had to go through a multi step verification process to cancel. He said they dont need to verify via this identification process and that the agent has the right to terminate my card based on my saying I was thinking about cancelling and terminating the call ( even though I said I didnt want to cancel it before I terminated the call ). I told XXXX this was not correct and that I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB. He then stated he was going to review the tape. He disappeared for a couple minutes and returned to the phone to which he said the tape was lost or was not recorded, but not to worry because I no longer needed to contact the CFPB because he was investigating. I replied that I would be filing a report for just this reason, Citi are acting in a dishonest manner and need a real investigation. \\n\\nI am writing in hopes of getting my card reinstated. I have another complaint with the CFPB that I filed yesterday in regards to their Dispute Resolution process. I believe that because of my initial complaint to Citi on Saturday night that led to them spitefully cancelling my card.
